# Treasury Yield Curve Order App

A full-stack serverless application that allows users to view treasury yield curve data and place investment orders based on the selected term and rate. The application is built with **React**, **AWS Lambda**, **API Gateway**, and **DynamoDB**, and is fully deployable via **AWS CDK**.

1. **Frontend (React)** ‚Äì Displays the yield curve, provides an investment form, and shows past orders.
2. **API Gateway** ‚Äì Exposes RESTful HTTP endpoints to the frontend.
3. **AWS Lambda** ‚Äì Handles API requests for yield data and investment orders.
4. **DynamoDB** ‚Äì Stores submitted orders in a table named `TreasuryOrders`.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js ‚â• 18](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)
- [AWS CLI configured](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-quickstart.html)
- [AWS CDK v2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/getting-started.html) ‚Äî install via:
     ```bash
    npm install -g aws-cdk
    ```
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) ‚Äî required for bundling Lambda code

---

### Step 1: Deploy the Backend
From the root of the project:

```bash
cd infrastructure/aws
```
Make sure Docker is running, then execute:

```bash
./dev-deploy.sh
```

This deploys:
- API Gateway endpoint
- Lambda function with route handlers
- DynamoDB table for storing orders

| üê≥ Note: Docker is required for bundling the Lambda function. Ensure it‚Äôs running before executing the script.

| üìò After deployment, the API Gateway URL will be printed in your terminal ‚Äî you‚Äôll need it in the next step.

### Step 2: Set Up Environment Variables
Navigate to the frontend directory:

```bash
cd ../../treasury-yield-app
```
Create a .env file and add the following:

```bash
VITE_API_GATEWAY_URL=https://<your-api-id>.execute-api.<region>.amazonaws.com/dev/
```
Replace `<your-api-id>` and `<region>` with the actual values printed after deployment.


### Step 3: Start the Frontend App

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Once started, the app will be available at: http://localhost:5173
